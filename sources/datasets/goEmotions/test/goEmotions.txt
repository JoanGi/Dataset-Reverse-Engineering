Abstract
Understanding emotion expressed in language
has a wide range of applications, from building empathetic chatbots to detecting harmful
online behavior. Advancement in this area can
be improved using large-scale datasets with
a fine-grained typology, adaptable to multiple downstream tasks. We introduce GoEmotions, the largest manually annotated dataset
of 58k English Reddit comments, labeled for
27 emotion categories or Neutral. We demonstrate the high quality of the annotations via
Principal Preserved Component Analysis. We
conduct transfer learning experiments with existing emotion benchmarks to show that our
dataset generalizes well to other domains and
different emotion taxonomies. Our BERTbased model achieves an average F1-score of
.46 across our proposed taxonomy, leaving
much room for improvement.1

Introduction

Emotion expression and detection are central to the
human experience and social interaction. With as
many as a handful of words we are able to express a
wide variety of subtle and complex emotions, and it
has thus been a long-term goal to enable machines
to understand affect and emotion (Picard, 1997).
In the past decade, NLP researchers made available several datasets for language-based emotion
classification for a variety of domains and applications, including for news headlines (Strapparava
and Mihalcea, 2007), tweets (CrowdFlower, 2016;
Mohammad et al., 2018), and narrative sequences
(Liu et al., 2019), to name just a few. However, existing available datasets are (1) mostly small, containing up to several thousand instances, and (2)
cover a limited emotion taxonomy, with coarse clas∗

sification into Ekman (Ekman, 1992b) or Plutchik
(Plutchik, 1980) emotions.
Recently, Bostan and Klinger (2018) have aggregated 14 popular emotion classification corpora
under a unified framework that allows direct comparison of the existing resources. Importantly,
their analysis suggests annotation quality gaps in
the largest manually annotated emotion classification dataset, CrowdFlower (2016), containing
40K tweets labeled for one of 13 emotions. While
their work enables such comparative evaluations, it
highlights the need for a large-scale, consistently
labeled emotion dataset over a fine-grained taxonomy, with demonstrated high-quality annotations.
To this end, we compiled GoEmotions, the
largest human annotated dataset of 58k carefully
selected Reddit comments, labeled for 27 emotion
categories or Neutral, with comments extracted
from popular English subreddits. Table 1 shows an
illustrative sample of our collected data. We design
our emotion taxonomy considering related work in
psychology and coverage in our data. In contrast to
Ekman’s taxonomy, which includes only one positive emotion (joy), our taxonomy includes a large
number of positive, negative, and ambiguous emotion categories, making it suitable for downstream

conversation understanding tasks that require a subtle understanding of emotion expression, such as
the analysis of customer feedback or the enhancement of chatbots.
We include a thorough analysis of the annotated
data and the quality of the annotations. Via Principal Preserved Component Analysis (Cowen et al.,
2019b), we show a strong support for reliable dissociation among all 27 emotion categories, indicating
the suitability of our annotations for building an
emotion classification model.
We perform hierarchical clustering on the emotion judgments, finding that emotions related in
intensity cluster together closely and that the toplevel clusters correspond to sentiment categories.
These relations among emotions allow for their
potential grouping into higher-level categories, if
desired for a downstream task.
We provide a strong baseline for modeling finegrained emotion classification over GoEmotions.
By fine-tuning a BERT-base model (Devlin et al.,
2019), we achieve an average F1-score of .46 over
our taxonomy, .64 over an Ekman-style grouping
into six coarse categories and .69 over a sentiment
grouping. These results leave much room for improvement, showcasing this task is not yet fully
addressed by current state-of-the-art NLU models.
We conduct transfer learning experiments with
existing emotion benchmarks to show that our
data can generalize to different taxonomies and
domains, such as tweets and personal narratives.
Our experiments demonstrate that given limited resources to label additional emotion classification
data for specialized domains, our data can provide
baseline emotion understanding and contribute to
increasing model accuracy for the target domain.

Emotion Datasets

Ever since Affective Text (Strapparava and Mihalcea, 2007), the first benchmark for emotion recognition was introduced, the field has seen several
emotion datasets that vary in size, domain and taxonomy (cf. Bostan and Klinger, 2018). The majority of emotion datasets are constructed manually,
but tend to be relatively small. The largest manually labeled dataset is CrowdFlower (2016), with
39k labeled examples, which were found by Bostan
and Klinger (2018) to be noisy in comparison with
other emotion datasets. Other datasets are automatically weakly-labeled, based on emotion-related

hashtags on Twitter (Wang et al., 2012; AbdulMageed and Ungar, 2017). We build our dataset
manually, making it the largest human annotated
dataset, with multiple annotations per example for
quality assurance.
Several existing datasets come from the domain
of Twitter, given its informal language and expressive content, such as emojis and hashtags. Other
datasets annotate news headlines (Strapparava and
Mihalcea, 2007), dialogs (Li et al., 2017), fairytales (Alm et al., 2005), movie subtitles (Öhman
et al., 2018), sentences based on FrameNet (Ghazi
et al., 2015), or self-reported experiences (Scherer
and Wallbott, 1994) among other domains. We are
the first to build on Reddit comments for emotion
prediction.
2.2

Emotion Taxonomy

One of the main aspects distinguishing our dataset
is its emotion taxonomy. The vast majority of existing datasets contain annotations for minor variations of the 6 basic emotion categories (joy, anger,
fear, sadness, disgust, and surprise) proposed by
Ekman (1992a) and/or along affective dimensions
(valence and arousal) that underpin the circumplex
model of affect (Russell, 2003; Buechel and Hahn,
2017).
Recent advances in psychology have offered new
conceptual and methodological approaches to capturing the more complex “semantic space” of emotion (Cowen et al., 2019a) by studying the distribution of emotion responses to a diverse array of stimuli via computational techniques. Studies guided
by these principles have identified 27 distinct varieties of emotional experience conveyed by short
videos (Cowen and Keltner, 2017), 13 by music
(Cowen et al., in press), 28 by facial expression
(Cowen and Keltner, 2019), 12 by speech prosody
(Cowen et al., 2019b), and 24 by nonverbal vocalization (Cowen et al., 2018). In this work, we build
on these methods and findings to devise our granular taxonomy for text-based emotion recognition
and study the dimensionality of language-based
emotion space.
2.3

Emotion Classification Models

Both feature-based and neural models have been
used to build automatic emotion classification models. Feature-based models often make use of handbuilt lexicons, such as the Valence Arousal Dominance Lexicon (Mohammad, 2018). Using representations from BERT (Devlin et al., 2019), a

transformer-based model with language model pretraining, has recently shown to reach state-of-theart performance on several NLP tasks, also including emotion prediction: the top-performing models
in the EmotionX Challenge (Hsu and Ku, 2018) all
employed a pre-trained BERT model. We also use
the BERT model in our experiments and we find
that it outperforms our biLSTM model.

GoEmotions

Our dataset is composed of 58K Reddit comments,
labeled for one or more of 27 emotion(s) or Neutral.
3.1

Selecting & Curating Reddit comments

We use a Reddit data dump originating in the redditdata-tools project2 , which contains comments from
2005 (the start of Reddit) to January 2019. We
select subreddits with at least 10k comments and
remove deleted and non-English comments.
Reddit is known for a demographic bias leaning towards young male users (Duggan and Smith,
2013), which is not reflective of a globally diverse
population. The platform also introduces a skew
towards toxic, offensive language (Mohan et al.,
2017). Thus, Reddit content has been used to study
depression (Pirina and Çöltekin, 2018), microaggressions (Breitfeller et al., 2019), and Yanardag
and Rahwan (2018) have shown the effect of using biased Reddit data by training a “psychopath”
bot. To address these concerns, and enable building
broadly representative emotion models using GoEmotions, we take a series of data curation measures
to ensure our data does not reinforce general, nor
emotion-specific, language biases.
We identify harmful comments using pre-defined
lists containing offensive/adult, vulgar (mildly offensive profanity), identity, and religion terms (included as supplementary material). These are used
for data filtering and masking, as described below.
Lists were internally compiled and we believe they
are comprehensive and widely useful for dataset
curation, however, they may not be complete.
Reducing profanity. We remove subreddits that
are not safe for work3 and where 10%+ of comments include offensive/adult and vulgar tokens.
We remove remaining comments that include offensive/adult tokens. Vulgar comments are preserved
as we believe they are central to learning about

negative emotions. The dataset includes the list of
filtered tokens.
Manual review. We manually review identity
comments and remove those offensive towards a
particular ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, or
disability, to the best of our judgment.
Length filtering. We apply NLTK’s word tokenizer and select comments 3-30 tokens long, including punctuation. To create a relatively balanced
distribution of comment length, we perform downsampling, capping by the number of comments
with the median token count (12).
Sentiment balancing. We reduce sentiment bias
by removing subreddits with little representation
of positive, negative, ambiguous, or neutral sentiment. To estimate a comment’s sentiment, we run
our emotion prediction model, trained on a pilot
batch of 2.2k annotated examples. The mapping
of emotions into sentiment categories is found in
Figure 2. We exclude subreddits consisting of more
than 30% neutral comments or less than 20% of
negative, positive, or ambiguous comments.
Emotion balancing. We assign a predicted emotion to each comment using the pilot model described above. Then, we reduce emotion bias by
downsampling the weakly-labelled data, capping
by the number of comments belonging to the median emotion count.
Subreddit balancing. To avoid over representation of popular subreddits, we perform downsampling, capping by the median subreddit count.
From the remaining 315k comments (from 482
subreddits), we randomly sample for annotation.
Masking. We mask proper names referring to
people with a [NAME] token, using a BERT-based
Named Entity Tagger (Tsai et al., 2019). We mask
religion terms with a [RELIGION] token. The list
of these terms is included with our dataset. Note
that raters viewed unmasked comments during rating.
3.2

Taxonomy of Emotions

When creating the taxonomy, we seek to jointly
maximize the following objectives.
1. Provide greatest coverage in terms of emotions expressed in our data. To address this, we
manually labeled a small subset of the data, and
ran a pilot task where raters can suggest emotion
labels on top of the pre-defined set.

2. Provide greatest coverage in terms of kinds
of emotional expression. We consult psychology
literature on emotion expression and recognition
(Plutchik, 1980; Cowen and Keltner, 2017; Cowen
et al., 2019b). Since, to our knowledge, there
has not been research that identifies principal categories for emotion recognition in the domain of
text (see Section 2.2), we consider those emotions
that are identified as basic in other domains (video
and speech) and that we can assume to apply to
text as well.
3. Limit overlap among emotions and limit the
number of emotions. We do not want to include
emotions that are too similar, since that makes the
annotation task more difficult. Moreover, combining similar labels with high coverage would result
in an explosion in annotated labels.
The final set of selected emotions is listed in
Table 4, and Figure 1. See Appendix B for more
details on our multi-step taxonomy selection procedure.
3.3

Annotation

We assigned three raters to each example. For those
examples where no raters agree on at least one
emotion label, we assigned two additional raters.
All raters are native English speakers from India.4
Instructions. Raters were asked to identify the
emotions expressed by the writer of the text, given
pre-defined emotion definitions (see Appendix A)
and a few example texts for each emotion. Raters
were free to select multiple emotions, but were
asked to only select those ones for which they were
reasonably confident that it is expressed in the text.
If raters were not certain about any emotion being
expressed, they were asked to select Neutral. We
included a checkbox for raters to indicate if an
example was particularly difficult to label, in which
case they could select no emotions. We removed
all examples for which no emotion was selected.
The rater interface. Reddit comments were presented with no additional metadata (such as the
author or subreddit). To help raters navigate the
large space of emotion in our taxonomy, they were
presented a table containing all emotion categories
aggregated by sentiment (by the mapping in Figure 2) and whether that emotion is generally expressed towards something (e.g. disapproval) or is

Cowen et al. (2019b) find that emotion judgments in Indian and US English speakers largely occupy the same dimensions.

more of an intrinsic feeling (e.g. joy). The instructions highlighted that this separation of categories
was by no means clear-cut, but captured general
tendencies, and we encouraged raters to ignore the
categorization whenever they saw fit. Emotions
with a straightforward mapping onto emojis were
shown with an emoji in the UI, to further ease their
interpretation.

Data Analysis

Table 2 shows summary statistics for the data. Most
of the examples (83%) have a single emotion label
and have at least two raters agreeing on a single label (94%). The Neutral category makes up 26% of
all emotion labels – we exclude that category from
the following analyses, since we do not consider it
to be part of the semantic space of emotions.
Figure 1 shows the distribution of emotion labels.
We can see a large disparity in terms of emotion
frequencies (e.g. admiration is 30 times more frequent than grief ), despite our emotion and sentiment balancing steps taken during data selection.
This is expected given the disparate frequencies of
emotions in natural human expression.
4.1

Interrater Correlation

We estimate rater agreement for each emotion via
interrater correlation (Delgado and Tibau, 2019).5
For each rater r ∈ R, we calculate the Spearman
correlation between r’s judgments and the mean
5

We use correlations as opposed to Cohen’s kappa (Cohen,
1960) because the former is a more interpretable metric and it
is also more suitable for measuring agreement among a variable number of raters rating different examples. In Appendix C
we report Cohen’s kappa values as well, which correlate highly
with the values obtained from interrater correlation (Pearson
r = 0.85, p < 0.001).

of other raters’ judgments, for all examples that r
rated. We then take the average of these rater-level
correlation scores. In Section 4.3, we show that
each emotion has significant interrater correlation,
after controlling for several potential confounds.
Figure 1 shows that gratitude, admiration and
amusement have the highest and grief and nervousness have the lowest interrater correlation. Emotion
frequency correlates with interrater agreement but
the two are not equivalent. Infrequent emotions
can have relatively high interrater correlation (e.g.,
fear), and frequent emotions can have have relatively low interrater correlation (e.g., annoyance).
4.2

Correlation Among Emotions

To better understand the relationship between emotions in our data, we look at their correlations. Let
N be the number of examples in our dataset. We
obtain N dimensional vectors for each emotion
by averaging raters’ judgments for all examples
labeled with that emotion. We calculate Pearson
correlation values between each pair of emotions.
The heatmap in Figure 2 shows that emotions that
are related in intensity (e.g. annoyance and anger,
joy and excitement, nervousness and fear) have
a strong positive correlation. On the other hand,
emotions that have the opposite sentiment are negatively correlated.

Figure 2: The heatmap shows the correlation between
ratings for each emotion. The dendrogram represents
the a hierarchical clustering of the ratings. The sentiment labeling was done a priori and it shows that the
clusters closely map onto sentiment groups.

We also perform hierarchical clustering to uncover the nested structure of our taxonomy. We
use correlation as a distance metric and ward as
a linkage method, applied to the averaged ratings.
The dendrogram on the top of Figure 2 shows that
emotions that are related by intensity are neighbors,
and that larger clusters map closely onto sentiment
categories. Interestingly, emotions that we labeled
as “ambiguous” in terms of sentiment (e.g. surprise) are closer to the positive than to the negative
category. This suggests that in our data, ambiguous
emotions are more likely to occur in the context of
positive sentiment than that of negative sentiment.
4.3

Principal Preserved Component Analysis

To better understand agreement among raters and
the latent structure of the emotion space, we apply
Principal Preserved Component Analysis (PPCA)
(Cowen et al., 2019b) to our data. PPCA extracts
linear combinations of attributes (here, emotion
judgments), that maximally covary across two sets
of data that measure the same attributes (here, randomly split judgments for each example). Thus,
PPCA allows us to uncover latent dimensions of

Unlike Principal Component Analysis (PCA),
PPCA examines the cross-covariance between
datasets rather than the variancecovariance matrix
within a single dataset. We obtain the principal
preserved components (PPCs) of two datasets (matrices) X, Y ∈ RN ×|E| , where N is the number
of examples and |E| is the number of emotions,
by calculating the eigenvectors of the symmetrized
cross covariance matrix X T Y + Y T X.
Extracting significant dimensions. We remove
examples labeled as Neutral, and keep those examples that still have at least 3 ratings after this
filtering step. We then determine the number of
significant dimensions using a leave-one-rater out
analysis, as described by Algorithm 1.
We find that all 27 PPCs are highly significant. Specifically, Bonferroni-corrected p-values
are less than 1.5e-6 for all dimensions (corrected
α = 0.0017), suggesting that the emotions were
highly dissociable. Such a high degree of significance for all dimensions is nontrivial. For example,
Cowen et al. (2019b) find that only 12 out of their
30 emotion categories are significantly dissociable.

t-SNE projection. To better understand how the
examples are organized in the emotion space, we
apply t-SNE, a dimension reduction method that
seeks to preserve distances between data points,
using the scikit-learn package (Pedregosa et al.,
2011). The dataset can be explored in our interactive plot6 , where one can also look at the texts
and the annotations. The color of each data point is
the weighted average of the RGB values representing those emotions that at least half of the raters
selected.
4.4

Linguistic Correlates of Emotions

We extract the lexical correlates of each emotion by
calculating the log odds ratio, informative Dirichlet
prior (Monroe et al., 2008) of all tokens for each
emotion category contrasting to all other emotions.
Since the log odds are z-scored, all values greater
than 3 indicate highly significant (>3 std) association with the corresponding emotion. We list the
top 5 tokens for each category in Table 3. We find
that those emotions that are highly significantly associated with certain tokens (e.g. gratitude with
“thanks”, amusement with “lol”) tend to have the
highest interrater correlation (see Figure 1). Conversely, emotions that have fewer significantly associated tokens (e.g. grief and nervousness) tend
to have low interrater correlation. These results
suggest certain emotions are more verbally implicit
and may require more context to be interpreted.

Modeling

We present a strong baseline emotion prediction
model for GoEmotions.
5.1

Data Preparation

To minimize the noise in our data, we filter out
emotion labels selected by only a single annotator.
We keep examples with at least one label after this
filtering is performed — this amounts to 93% of the
original data. We randomly split this data into train
(80%), dev (10%) and test (10%) sets. We only
evaluate on the test set once the model is finalized.
Even though we filter our data for the baseline
experiments, we see particular value in the 4K examples that lack agreement. This subset of the data
likely contains edge/difficult examples for the emotion domain (e.g., emotion-ambiguous text), and
present challenges for further exploration. That is

why we release all 58K examples with all annotators’ ratings.
Grouping emotions. We create a hierarchical
grouping of our taxonomy, and evaluate the model
performance on each level of the hierarchy. A sentiment level divides the labels into 4 categories –
positive, negative, ambiguous and Neutral – with
the Neutral category intact, and the rest of the mapping as shown in Figure 2. The Ekman level further
divides the taxonomy using the Neutral label and
the following 6 groups: anger (maps to: anger, annoyance, disapproval), disgust (maps to: disgust),
fear (maps to: fear, nervousness), joy (all positive
emotions), sadness (maps to: sadness, disappointment, embarrassment, grief, remorse) and surprise
(all ambiguous emotions).
5.2

Model Architecture

We use the BERT-base model (Devlin et al., 2019)
for our experiments. We add a dense output layer
on top of the pretrained model for the purposes
of finetuning, with a sigmoid cross entropy loss
function to support multi-label classification. As an
additional baseline, we train a bidirectional LSTM.
5.3

Parameter Settings

When finetuning the pre-trained BERT model, we
keep most of the hyperparameters set by Devlin
et al. (2019) intact and only change the batch size
and learning rate. We find that training for at least
4 epochs is necessary for learning the data, but
training for more epochs results in overfitting. We
also find that a small batch size of 16 and learning
rate of 5e-5 yields the best performance.
For the biLSTM, we set the hidden layer dimensionality to 256, the learning rate to 0.1, with a

decay rate of 0.95. We apply a dropout of 0.7.
5.4

Results

Table 4 summarizes the performance of our best
model, BERT, on the test set, which achieves an
average F1-score of .46 (std=.19). The model obtains the best performance on emotions with overt
lexical markers, such as gratitude (.86), amusement
(.8) and love (.78). The model obtains the lowest
F1-score on grief (0), relief (.15) and realization
(.21), which are the lowest frequency emotions. We
find that less frequent emotions tend to be confused
by the model with more frequent emotions related
in sentiment and intensity (e.g., grief with sadness,
pride with admiration, nervousness with fear) —
see Appendix G for a more detailed analysis.
Table 5 and Table 6 show results for a sentimentgrouped model (F1-score = .69) and an Ekmangrouped model (F1-score = .64), respectively. The
significant performance increase in the transition
from full to Ekman-level taxonomy indicates that
this grouping mitigates confusion among innergroup lower-level categories.
The biLSTM model performs significantly
worse than BERT, obtaining an average F1-score
of .41 for the full taxonomy, .53 for an Ekmangrouped model and .6 for a sentiment-grouped
model.

Transfer Learning Experiments

We conduct transfer learning experiments on existing emotion benchmarks, in order to show our data
generalizes across domains and taxonomies. The
goal is to demonstrate that given little labeled data
in a target domain, one can utilize GoEmotions as
baseline emotion understanding data.

ity and taxonomy. In the interest of space, we only
discuss three of these datasets here, chosen based
on their diversity of domains. In our experiments,
we observe similar trends for the additional benchmarks, and all are included in the Appendix H.
The International Survey on Emotion Antecedents and Reactions (ISEAR) (Scherer and
Wallbott, 1994) is a collection of personal reports
on emotional events, written by 3000 people from
different cultural backgrounds. The dataset contains 8k sentences, each labeled with a single emotion. The categories are anger, disgust, fear, guilt,
joy, sadness and shame.
EmoInt (Mohammad et al., 2018) is part of the
SemEval 2018 benchmark, and it contains crowdsourced annotations for 7k tweets. The labels are

intensity annotations for anger, joy, sadness, and
fear. We obtain binary annotations for these emotions by using .5 as the cutoff.
Emotion-Stimulus (Ghazi et al., 2015) contains
annotations for 2.4k sentences generated based on
FrameNet’s emotion-directed frames. Their taxonomy is anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, shame
and surprise.
6.2

Experimental Setup

Training set size. We experiment with varying
amount of training data from the target domain
dataset, including 100, 200, 500, 1000, and 80%
(named “max”) of dataset examples. We generate
10 random splits for each train set size, with the
remaining examples held as a test set.
We report the results of the finetuning experiments detailed below for each data size, with confidence intervals based on repeated experiments
using the splits.
Finetuning. We compare three different finetuning setups. In the BASELINE setup, we finetune
BERT only on the target dataset. In the FREEZE
setup, we first finetune BERT on GoEmotions, then
perform transfer learning by replacing the final
dense layer, freezing all layers besides the last
layer and finetuning on the target dataset. The
NOFREEZE setup is the same as FREEZE , except
that we do not freeze the bottom layers. We hold
the batch size at 16, learning rate at 2e-5 and number of epochs at 3 for all experiments.
6.3

Results

The results in Figure 3 suggest that our dataset generalizes well to different domains and taxonomies,
and that using a model using GoEmotions can help
in cases when there is limited data from the target
domain, or limited resources for labeling.
Given limited target domain data (100 or 200 examples), both FREEZE and NOFREEZE yield significantly higher performance than the BASELINE, for
all three datasets. Importantly, NOFREEZE results
show significantly higher performance for all training set sizes, except for “max”, where NOFREEZE
and BASELINE perform similarly.

Conclusion

We present GoEmotions, a large, manually annotated, carefully curated dataset for fine-grained
emotion prediction. We provide a detailed data

analysis, demonstrating the reliability of the annotations for the full taxonomy. We show the generalizability of the data across domains and taxonomies
via transfer learning experiments. We build a strong
baseline by fine-tuning a BERT model, however,
the results suggest much room for future improvement. Future work can explore the cross-cultural
robustness of emotion ratings, and extend the taxonomy to other languages and domains.
Data Disclaimer: We are aware that the dataset
contains biases and is not representative of global
diversity. We are aware that the dataset contains
potentially problematic content. Potential biases in
the data include: Inherent biases in Reddit and user
base biases, the offensive/vulgar word lists used
for data filtering, inherent or unconscious bias in
assessment of offensive identity labels, annotators
were all native English speakers from India. All
these likely affect labeling, precision, and recall
for a trained model. The emotion pilot model used
for sentiment labeling, was trained on examples
reviewed by the research team. Anyone using this
dataset should be aware of these limitations of the
dataset.

Acknowledgments
We thank the three anonymous reviewers for their
constructive feedback. We would also like to thank
the annotators for their hard work.

Taxonomy Selection & Data Collection

We selected our taxonomy through a careful multiround process. In the first pilot round of data col-

lection, we used emotions that were identified to be
salient by Cowen and Keltner (2017), making sure
that our set includes Ekmans emotion categories, as
used in previous NLP work. In this round, we also
included an open input box where annotators could
suggest emotion(s) that were not among the options. We annotated 3K examples in the first round.
We updated the taxonomy based on the results of
this round (see details below). In the second pilot
round of data collection, we repeated this process
with 2k new examples, once again updating the
taxonomy.
While reviewing the results from the pilot
rounds, we identified and removed emotions that
were scarcely selected by annotators and/or had
low interrater agreement due to being very similar
to other emotions or being too difficult to detect
from text. These emotions were boredom, doubt,
heartbroken, indifference and calmness. We also
identified and added those emotions to our taxonomy that were frequently suggested by raters
and/or seemed to be represented in the data upon
manual inspection. These emotions were desire,
disappointment, pride, realization, relief and remorse. In this process, we also refined the category
names (e.g. replacing ecstasy with excitement), to
ones that seemed interpretable to annotators. This
is how we arrived at the final set of 27 emotions
+ Neutral. Our high interrater agreement in the final data can be partially explained by the fact that
we took interpretability into consideration while
constructing the taxonomy. The dataset is we are
releasing was labeled in the third round over the
final taxonomy.

C

Cohen’s Kappa Values

In Section 4.1, we measure agreement between
raters via Spearman correlation, following considerations by Delgado and Tibau (2019). In Table 7,
we report the Cohen’s kappa values for comparison, which we obtain by randomly sampling two
ratings for each example and calculating the Cohen’s kappa between these two sets of ratings. We
find that all Cohen’s kappa values are greater than 0,
showing rater agreement. Moreover, the Cohen’s
kappa values correlate highly with the interrater
correlation values (Pearson r = 0.85, p < 0.001),
providing corroborative evidence for the significant
degree of interrater agreement for each emotion.

gravity (Tenney et al., 2019) based on scalar mixing
weights (Peters et al., 2018). We find that all layers
are similarly important for our task, with center of
gravity = 6.19 (see Figure 4). This is consistent
with Tenney et al. (2019), who have also found that
tasks involving high-level semantics tend to make
use of all BERT layers.

In Section 3, we describe how we obtain subreddits
that are balanced in terms of sentiment. Here, we
note the distribution of sentiments across subreddits before we apply the filtering: neutral (M=28%,
STD=11%), positive (M=41%, STD=11%), negative (M=19%, STD=7%), ambiguous (M=35%,
STD=8%). After filtering, the distribution of sentiments across our remaining subreddits became:
neutral (M=24%, STD=5%), positive (M=35%,
STD=6%), negative (M=27%, STD=4%), ambiguous (M=33%, STD=4%).

Confusion Matrix

Figure 6 shows the normalized confusion matrix for
our model predictions. Since GoEmotions is a multilabel dataset, we calculate the confusion matrix

similarly as we would calculate a co-occurrence
matrix: for each true label, we increase the count
for each predicted label. Specifically, we define a
matrix M where Mi,j denotes the raw confusion
count between the true label i and the predicted
label j. For example, if the true labels are joy
and admiration, and the predicted labels are joy
and pride, then we increase the count for Mjoy,joy ,
Mjoy,pride , Madmiration,joy and Madmiration,pride .
In practice, since most of our examples only has
a single label (see Figure 5), our confusion matrix
is very similar to one calculated for a single-label
classification task.
Given the disparate frequencies among the labels, we normalize M by dividing the counts in
each row (representing counts for each true emotion label) by the sum of that row. The heatmap in
Figure 6 shows these normalized counts. We find
that the model tends to confuse emotions that are
related in sentiment and intensity (e.g., grief and
sadness, pride and admiration, nervousness and
fear).
We also perform hierarchical clustering over the
normalized confusion matrix using correlation as a
distance metric and ward as a linkage method. We
find that the model learns relatively similar clusters
as the ones in Figure 2, even though the training
data only includes a subset of the labels that have
agreement (see Figure 5).

H

Transfer Learning Results

Figure 7 shows the results for all 9 datasets that
are downloadable and have categorical emotions
in the Unified Dataset (Bostan and Klinger, 2018).
These datasets are DailyDialog (Li et al., 2017),
Emotion-Stimulus (Ghazi et al., 2015), Affective
Text (Strapparava and Mihalcea, 2007), CrowdFlower (CrowdFlower, 2016), Electoral Tweets
(Mohammad et al., 2015), ISEAR (Scherer and
Wallbott, 1994), the Twitter Emotion Corpus (TEC)
(Mohammad, 2012), EmoInt (Mohammad et al.,
2018) and the Stance Sentiment Emotion Corpus
(SSEC) (Schuff et al., 2017).
We describe the experimental setup in Section 6.2, which we use across all datasets. We
find that transfer learning helps in the case of all
datasets, especially when there is limited training data. Interestingly, in the case of CrowdFlower, which is known to be noisy (Bostan and
Klinger, 2018) and Electoral Tweets, which is a
small dataset of ∼4k labeled examples and a large

taxonomy of 36 emotions, FREEZE gives a significant boost of performance over the BASELINE and
NOFREEZE for all training set sizes besides “max”.
For the other datasets, we find that FREEZE
tends to give a performance boost compared to the
other setups only up to a couple of hundred training examples. For 500-1000 training examples,
NOFREEZE tends to outperform the BASELINE, but
we can see that these two setups come closer when
there is more training data available. These results
suggests that our dataset helps if there is limited
data from the target domain.
